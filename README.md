# Understanding-Public-Opinions-on-Government-Policies-A-LSTM-BERT-Ensemble-and-Recommendation
This repository contains code for sentiment analysis on online feedback regarding government policies using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and an LSTM-BERT ensemble model. The project also builds a recommendation system to filter out relevant feedback data. The code is written in Python and utilizes several popular libraries.

# Project Goals
- Analyze public sentiment on government policies using NLP and an LSTM-BERT ensemble model.
- Develop a recommendation system to filter relevant feedback data from online sources such as Twitter.
- 
 # Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Rigorous cleaning and preprocessing of textual data, including tokenization and stop word removal.
- Sentiment Analysis: Leveraging NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer and a trained LSTM-BERT ensemble model to accurately classify sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral).
- Recommendation System: Filtering and recommending relevant feedback data based on sentiment and other predefined criteria.
  
# Evaluation
The code evaluates the performance of the sentiment analysis model using metrics like accuracy and classification report.
